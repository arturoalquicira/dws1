    <h1>Compare & Contrast Zen Garden Designs</h1>
    <p>I have chosen three different designs of some Web Designers from the website <em>Zen Garden</em> to compare and
        contrast the difference between their <strong>CSS</strong> styles.</p>
    <p>The designs that I chose were: <em>Make'em Proud, CSS Co,. LTD, and Under The Sea</em></p>
    <h2>Fonts & Headings</h2>
    <p>I see that the three designs set their font styles and sizes at the beginning on the body part trying to
        making it more general, but the design <em>Make'em Proud</em> sets other elements too besides the body like
        (div, span, applet, object, iframe, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre, etc)</p>
    <p>But the similarities are that the three designs use the id or classes to specify where they want to change font style or size</p>
    <h2>Text Colors & Background Colors</h2>
    <p>I have noticed that these design don't change often their text colors, they are constant, but sometimes they change it
        to remark something and do not use the <strong>strong</strong> element. For example <em>CSS Co,. LTD</em> design
        changes the color of the abbreviations using classes and the element <strong>abbr</strong> like this: .preamble abbr{.</p>
    <p>For the background colors they specify where do they want to change the color using the selector <em>background</em>
        and the declaration will be the color they prefer.</p>
    <p>Since they are several frames or divisions where information is displayed, they specify the background colors using
        the <em>div class.</em></p>
    <h2>Background Images</h2>
    <p>The background images seems to be more easy to insert, as long as you specify where you want to use them, normally you use the
        selector <em>background</em> and the declaration will be the <em>url</em> or the path where the image is located.</p>
    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <p>The layouts are different in each design and the layout normally refers to the padding, margin, align, float and other selectors
        that help you give like a kind of format to any text or image that you want to display on the page.</p>
