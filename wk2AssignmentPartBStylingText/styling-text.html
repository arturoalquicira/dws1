<h1>Longboard (skateboard)</h1>
<p id="intro">A longboard is a longer variant of a skateboard. It is commonly used for cruising, downhill racing, slalom
    racing, sliding, and/or transport.</p>

<h2 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
<hr />
<p>Most longboards measure 84 to 150 centimetres (33 to 59 in) long while the width varies from 22.8 to 25.4
    centimetres (9.0 to 10.0 in). There are several shapes of longboards, such as bumtails, flat-nose riders,
    drop through decks, drop decks and boards with the same shape of a standard skateboard. Pintails permit looser
    trucks and larger wheels which are better suited for carving or a "surfing" feel, whereas drop decks and drop
    throughs allow the rider to be closer to the ground, hence a lower center of gravity which increases stability
    and allows these boards to support more high speed downhill riding disciplines. Mid-length boards, 94 to 127
    centimetres (37 to 50 in) are the most versatile. Their greater weight and bulk makes them less suitable for
    many skateboarding tricks, but contributes to a fluid motion by providing more momentum. The longboard's design
    allows for big turns or quick short carves similar to the motions of surfers or snowboarders. Longboards have 3
    axis. The tail axis (running from tail to tail), the central axis (running straight down through the center of
    the board), and the short axis (running from the width of the board, perpendicular to the tail axis).</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment & protection</h2>
<hr />
<p>'Helmet culture' in the sport of longboarding is much stronger than in skateboarding. Most riders wear
    protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a helmet and gloves. Longboard
    equipment is similar to standard skateboard equipment, with the exception of slide gloves. Most longboarders
    wear slide gloves and helmets, as these are considered the bare minimum for protection. Additional protection
    includes; leathers, wrist guards, knee pads, elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and padded shorts.
    Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and advocate all aspects of protection.
    In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear "slide gloves" which are specialized gloves made out of
    a strong materials such as leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called "pucks" attached to the
    palms. These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides along the
    ground.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<hr />
<p>Longboards are skateboards in terms of parts and general construction. However, the parts generally have
    different dimensions and the wheels may be softer. Some, however, have relatively hard wheels, which makes
    longboards feel quite different than the ubiquitous skateboard.</p>
<h3 id="decks">Decks</h3>
<p>Longboard decks are typically made from plywood anywhere from two to eleven layers of usually 2 millimetres
    (0.079 in) in thickness, composed of birch, bamboo, or maple. Longboards are commercially available in a
    variety of shapes and sizes. Each variety has certain advantages and disadvantages, which come into play
    depending on the technique or personal preferences of the rider.</p>
<p>Decks intended for riding downhill are typically stiff and have a wheelbase of around 30"-28" . Designers and
    manufacturers aim to make these boards as stiff and light as possible. The primary three designs of downhill
    boards are "drop decks", "top mounts" and "drop throughs". Each design has its own advantages.</p>
<p>The "drop deck" has a lowered foot platform that sits below the height of the trucks, as a result, there is a
    lower center of gravity which adds to stability but gives you less traction and maneuverability. Wooden drop
    decks with concave have foot pockets by the drops. However, some carbon boards are able feature concave by the
    drops instead of foot pockets giving you more leverage in your turn.
    The "drop through" design has cutouts that allow the baseplate of the truck to protrude through the board, thus
    lowering the deck and providing more stability. In addition to this, drop through decks decrease grip, as the
    deck is closer to the axle and Moment arm of the wheel. There is also less leverage on the truck, which makes
    turning negligibly more difficult.</p>
<h4 id="pintail">Pintails</h4>
<p>The pintail shape is used to prevent the wheel from coming in contact with the board (called "wheelbite") while
    still providing ample footspace. Pintails are most commonly used with top mounted trucks.</p>
<h4 id="cruiser">Cruiser </h4>
<p>A most common deck shape, these have a somewhat similar shape to normal skateboards, in that they have a
    kick-tail on the back. The main difference is it has trucks that are higher than standard skateboard truck
    also the wheels may be larger and are much softer then standard skateboard wheels. The bushings are much more
    flexible, giving the rider the ability to turn and maneuver more efficiently.</p>
<h4 id="hybrid">Hybrid</h4>
<p>These kind of longboards include wheel cutouts which provide room for the wheels to turn at sharper angles
    while avoiding wheelbite. Hybrids also tend to be shorter than other longboards, which allows the rider to
    complete the same tricks as on a standard skateboard. A downside of hybrid longboards is the potential for
    "shoebite" which happens when the rider's shoe rubs the wheel, slowing or abruptly stopping the rider.</p>
<h3 id="trucks">Trucks</h3>
<p>Trucks are the metal turning mechanism that attach the longboard wheels to the deck. They come in a wide
    range of styles, with wider trucks meaning a wider turning circle. They use the motion of the rider's feet
    and body to turn the board by pivoting a joint in the middle of the truck. There are generally two types of
    trucks used on longboards: reverse kingpin trucks and conventional skateboard trucks (vertical kingpin).
    Conventional skateboard trucks have the axle on the outer side (towards the nose and tail) of the kingpin,
    whereas reverse kingpin trucks have the axle on the inner side (towards the center of the board) of the
    kingpin.</p>
<h3 id="bearings">Bearings</h3>
<p>Bearings connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel
    (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually
    rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1-13, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more
    precise, or smoother rolling, the bearing. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use
    ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability.</p>
<h3 id="wheels">Wheels</h3>
<p>Almost all longboard wheels are made from urethane. The performance of longboard wheels is determined by five
    characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, durometer, and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range
    from 65 to 107 millimetres (2.6 to 4.2 in). A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling
    speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer
    wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a
    softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a.
    Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is the width of
    the section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction
    it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from 30 to 80 millimetres (1.2 to 3.1 in) in width, but most commonly
    between 40 and 56 millimetres (1.6 and 2.2 in). The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction.</p>
